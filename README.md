# SQL (Structured Query Language)

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a domain specific language used to manage data held in relational database management system (RDBMS).
It is particularly good for structured data.

Not to confuse with "noSQL Database" which refers to non-relational database. However some [noSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database can use SQL like queries or be used in coordination with SQL managed databases (ie: the SQL databases for short).
